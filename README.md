The aim of this project is to buy an app which accepts an input string and predicts the next word., as proposed by SwiftKey.

The data used for the project is from the HC Corpora.

The initial scripts 'script1', 'script2', 'script3' have to be executed in this order.   
'script1' is interested in loading, sampling and cleaning the documents.  
'script2' generates the n-grams which will be later used for the model.   
'script3' saves the environment with the data needed for the model and app.

Then, 'ui.R' and 'server.R' perform the creation of the app. The app is optimized for mobiles and can be loaded in any browser.
The app is available here : https://dahssarah.shinyapps.io/app1
