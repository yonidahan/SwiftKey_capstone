The initial scripts 'script1', 'script2', 'script3' have to be executed in this specific order.   
'script1' is interested in loading, sampling he files and cleaning them using regular expressions.   
'script2' generates the n-grams which will be later used for the model.   
'script3' saves the environment with the data needed for the model and app.
